## Passions 👯

Seeing my impact at early startups, delighting internal and external customers.

## Learnings 🌱

Writing partners on product, engineering, and marketing teams gave me a toolbox for collaborative writing:

- Blog posts and whitepapers about technology standards and trends for a B2B audience
- User manuals, how-tos, integration guides, and API references that help data engineers and no-code data analysts skill up
- UX copy and landing page copywriting
- SEO/GEO best practices, optimizing content for targeted keywords
- Helping shape brand and style guides
- Runbooks, test environments, and internal documentation that reduce iterations
- Docs as code: static site generators, Markdown, Git, SVN, make, gradle
