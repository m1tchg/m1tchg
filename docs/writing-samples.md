# Writing Samples

## Organizing Maintenance Chaos with Reusable Content

I owned the accuracy and UX of documentation that was as volatile as [300+ SaaS, NoSQL, and big data APIs](https://www.cdata.com/kb/help/). Slack is one example of an API in constant flux. It took a little magic to maintain gritty details on how to execute [SQL to Slack](https://cdn.cdata.com/help/FCK/odbc/pg_table-channels.htm), and then sync code examples like [parameterized queries in Node.js](https://cdn.cdata.com/help/FCK/odbc/pg_odbclangnodejsparams.htm). To keep up with CData’s rapidly expanding lineup, I built documentation as part of the product build. I wrote reusable content and generated code examples that accelerated developers’ first drafts across CData’s engineering teams in the US, China, Albania, Japan, and India. To document a suite of tools for a new data source, a developer could use any other data source as a template.

## Implementing a New Documentation View for Asteria Warp

CData’s global teams gave me the technical, writing, and collaboration toolbox I needed in Tokyo to gather knowledge into a [new task-based documentation view](https://help.asteria.com/documentation/warp/en/current/flow/designer/index_guide.html) for Asteria’s Warp no-code data integration platform. In the [original English documentation](https://help.asteria.com/documentation/warp/en/1912/flow/designer/index_guide.html), users working their way through this graphical tool had to mentally assemble technical specifications into the steps they needed. I “translated” technical information into new overviews and modular guides that users could confidently jump across and combine into narratives that navigated their unique drag-and-drop workflows.

## Writing and Editing Cross-Functionally

When you’re the only technical writer, you learn that everyone’s a writer. Solving other teams’ problems, giving and receiving feedback with respect, I built the relationships a technical writer relies on to gather and share knowledge.

When CData’s CMO asked me to ensure that [product landing pages](https://www.cdata.com/drivers/salesforce/odbc/) reflected the key features for each data source, I was sharing knowledge that I had gathered from engineering and product teams during development cycles. I had also helped test some features, like the Unix ODBC driver’s Unicode support. My transparent, but impactful, edits won [guest](https://www.crmsoftwareblog.com/2015/08/synchronize-google-contacts-dynamics-crm/) [blogging](https://www.odata.org/blog/netsuite-salesforce-lightning-connect/) projects and knowledge on SEO best practices.

## Crafting Comprehensive Documentation

The [overview for ODBC drivers](https://cdn.cdata.com/help/RLK/odbc/) like Google Sheets is the entry point to documentation that’s crafted with methodical storytelling. To write the overviews, I gathered key features from marketing, then continued the narrative. To write the next steps, I gathered content strategy, technical information, and audience knowledge from subject matter experts. Informed by this newfound lens, I analyzed and adapted craft elements in model documentation to write a CData version that concretely improved on its sources of inspiration.

## Owning User Experience through Documentation

I wrote and generated comprehensive documentation like the [Admin API reference](https://cdn.cdata.com/help/AZJ/mft/Admin-API.html) for the CData Arc no-code platform. To own UX through documentation, it was critical that the often humble API reference simplified complex real-world journeys. I surfaced the right level of information to deliver faster answers whether you’re approaching an API for the first time or developing an application.
